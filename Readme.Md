Description: This project is a card Music memory game. theyre 8 artis that you need tomacth the card up with.

I used alot of CSS to make this game. I used animations, hover tags and different css elements to get my game to have the desired effect. However towards the last couple days i ran into some issues as i moved along my project. Sometimes My code would break then i would fix it just for something else to break. I had to take out my javascript because i was unable to mfix my game and my code was hard to read.# stoneskates20-gmail.com
